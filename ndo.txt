Some more about me...<br> 
<!-- bitlagbitlagbitlagbitlagbitlagbitlag -->
After Uni, I came to Germany and began working as a System Administrator at a datacenter in Frankfurt. The company was relatively small, so I had a ton of room to grow, learn, and experiment with things.
<!-- bitlagbitlagbitlagbitlagbitlagbitlag --><br>
This led to falling in love with Linux generally, Ubuntu more specifically, and Xubuntu most specifically. As well as the whole world of Dev Ops / Automation. <br> 
<!-- bitlagbitlagbitlagbitlagbitlagbitlag -->
More and more development work in my Sys Admin roll began creating an appetite for more professional Web Development work. Which led to the next chapter in my life, <a href="https://syzygy.com">Syzygy</a>
